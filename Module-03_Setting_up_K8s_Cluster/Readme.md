# Installing and Configuring Kubernetes Clusters

In this module, we're going to learn the following topics:

- **01-Hands-on Kubernetes tooling**

- **02-Installing and configuring a Kubernetes cluster**

- **03-Using `minikube` to set up a single node Kubernetes cluster**

- **04-Using `kubeadm` to install a basic (multi-node) Kubernetes cluster**

- **05-Setting up a highly available cluster with kubeadm**

## Step-01: Kubernetes tooling

- There are some widely used Kubernetes tools available in the market to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Some of them are as follows:

### kubectl

- `kubectl` is a Kubernetes command-line tool used to talk to the Kubernetes cluster.
- There are a handful of `kubectl` commands available that will allow users to work with the Kubernetes cluster, such as:

  - deploying a containerized application
  - managing cluster resources
  - monitoring and visualizing events and logs

- [Install and Set Up kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

```

```
